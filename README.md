# Holzflix

Inspired by [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) layout, this app tries to mimic some of their features, acting as a video catalog themed page.

This project was made during the React Immersion week promoted by [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/).<br>
And bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

This will also run a local JSON Server, wich will be used as backend for the application


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
